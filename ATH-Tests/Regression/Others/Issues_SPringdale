AGENDA / ITEMS for DISCUSSION: 

 

ISSUES:
1. Individual concerns of unit owners
- Scheduled reinspection of units with raised issues this week to verify the severity and if other issues were added to previous concerns. 
TIMELINE: November 2020 is the targeted time for the issues to be addressed, as a new contractor is yet to be determined. 
 

2. Retention pond opening
- Ads tarp as covering for said portion is in the works and target installation is supposedly today(Wednesday). 
TIMELINE: Full completion of ongoing construction is targeted this month. Permanent covering in the area is a chainlink/cyclone fence. 

 

3. Meralco posts and individual Meralco connections
- Current no. of units that needs to be addressed is < 10. TIMELINE: Individual Permanent Meralco connection - 2 to 3 months after Move-in. 

 

4. Grass cutting schedule implementation.
- For turned over units, who wants their units to be included in the grass cutting works, a billing process is yet to be determined, and will be provided by the PMG group in the coming weeks. Based on the meeting last week, grass cutting machine is still not working as expected, so the temporary solution provided was doing it manually. 

 

5. Followup on the request for the Brgy. to implement an impound activity on the subdivision premises.
- The letter to City Municipal was followed up and is still awaiting response. An anti-rabies vaccination activity is lined up depending on the preferred date of homeowners. Earliest possible time is this weekend, if everyone is OK with it. 

 

6. Billing concerns for the previous months both electric and water
- PMG was not present during the meeting and there is still no response yet. But the cause of delay was a problem in the Overall Report Printing

 

7. Water puddle caused by heavy downpour in some parts of the subdivision. 
- Already lined up for inlet repairs

 

8. Update as to the current total no. of homeowners already residing in the subdivision,and will that number suffice for us to apply for our own Manila water connection
- 95 units already has the authority to move in. The application process is ongoing, and the proposal is that RLC will handle the application fees. Afterwhich, unit owners will reimburse to RLC whatever fees were paid for on our behalf.
 

9. Reinspection of ALL groves/bricks stability to ensure that no incident related to fallen groves will be reported- All units will be reinspected but units with wall cladding issues already reported will be prioritized.

 

10. Stricter security implementation or roving guards especially in the areas near the highway or those that are not well lit. 
- Security officers will be roving every 15minutes, instead of the usual 30min. especially in mentioned areas.It is being requested by RLC, if possible, that residents near the area along the highway, help ensure the area is lit esp. at night to ensure no incidents of outsiders crossing thru the wall be reported again. 

 

11. Canopy/ Roofing for laundry area request. If it is possible to implement a “template” or specific dimensions/measurements to be sent out so homeowners would no longer be required to provide blueprints for said house improvements.
- LAUNDRY AREA- All allowed measurements are already stated in the Deed of Restrictions, so a template request is not possible. A blueprint copy is still required.
- CANOPY- a letter of certification from the LGU stating that a Bldg. permit is no longer required may be submitted together with an A3 size layout of design, instead of the usual blueprints necessary for home improvements. 


12. Elevated Land CHB - Expected Max height of CHB is 1M. or at least 4 bricks depending on the situation of the elevated area. 


REQUESTS:

1. Previous request for the waiting shed outside of the gate. 
- Area is already part of the highway, and no longer under RLC. PMG will need to request the LGU if said waiting shed may still be in place.
